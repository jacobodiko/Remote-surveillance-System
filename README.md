This code provides a complete solution for remotely controlling and monitoring a surveillance system using an ESP32. The integration with Blynk allows for an intuitive interface for the user, where multiple actions (door lock, motor control, GPS tracking, emergency systems) can be managed. When properly integrated with hardware components, it becomes a robust surveillance platform
